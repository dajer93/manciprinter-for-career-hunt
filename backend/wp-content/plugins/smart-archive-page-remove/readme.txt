Completely remove unwanted Archive Pages from your Blog

== Description ==

The [smart Archive Page Remove](https://petersplugins.com/free-wordpress-plugins/smart-archive-page-remove/) Plugin allows you to remove Archive Pages automatically generated by WordPress

<strong>If you like this plugin</strong> please do me favor and leave a review here on wordpress.org so that other people know it is helpful for you. Thanks!

== Usage ==

WordPress automatically generates Author based, Category based, Tag based and Date based (daily, monthly and yearly) archives for your posts. Even if you do not want to use these Pages - e.g. you don't want to have an author based archive page on a single author blog or you don't want to have a daily archive because you don't post several times a day - they exist and they can be accessed by their automated generated URL.

The smart Archive Page Remove Plugin adds an item 'Archive Pages' in the 'Settings' section of your WordPress Admin. Here you can select which Archive Pages you want to **remove**. Removed Archive Pages are no longer accessible and cause a 404 page not found error. They can be restored anytime.
